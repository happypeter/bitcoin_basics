25年前，Stephen R. Covey
写了一本书，把最近两百年来成功的智慧总结成了7个习惯。这本书后来在全球畅销，买了
2500 万本。书名叫做《高效人士的七个习惯 - 自我提升课程》

今天我们要说的却是：高效比特币人的七个习惯。

### 什么是比特币人?

先来定义一下，什么才是一个“比特币人”。如果你只是用比特币买东西，还称不上一个比特币人。比特币是一种生活方式，比特币人崇尚个人自由，他们相信我们在网上买东西不需要一个第三方机构的介入，大家的各项权力应该得到保护，包括隐私权，自由集会权，私有财产权。珍惜这些权利，热爱自由，并且坚信交易隐私应该得到保护的人就是一个很高效的比特币人。

不管我们自己多么的喜欢我们自己的独立，我们也要意识到我们是和他人生活在一起的，我们希望大家都能喜欢我们的这些原则，但是我们不能强求。不过，确实有些人还没有意识到他们理应拥有的这些权利，将会是多么的值钱。

首先要讲的三个习惯都是关于个性独立的，关于如何去做一个更优秀的人。

### 习惯一：做个主动的人

充满主动性，果断做出一些忠于自己人生原则的决定，是成为高效人士的决定性因素。要敢于为自己的选择负责。书中，作者引用了圣弗兰西斯的一段祷告：

上天啊，请让我从容的去接受那些我没有能力去改变的事情，让我勇敢的去改变那些我可以去改变的事情，同时让我有智慧去区分这两类事情。

作者描绘了两个圈子，一个是我们能影响的圈子，这里面主要包括我们自己和那些我们可以触及的人，在这个圈子之外是我们所关心的圈子，这个圈子里发生什么事我们会担心，但是我们没有能力去改变。而我们自己需要做的，就是要在我们能够影响的圈子里，做到足够的积极。

### 第二个习惯：目标清晰

这个说的就是要有一个目标。当你很清楚的知道自己要做什么的时候，要做成也就不那么难了。那我们作为比比特币人想要做什么呢？其实我们就是希望更多的人都来使用比特币。我们希望各种技术手段能够研发出来，保护我们的自由。在上一集节目中，我给大家说，未来应该是黑暗的。

注意，是好的黑暗，不是坏得黑暗。意思是到了那个时候，凡是我们想要的隐私都能得到保证，我们的可以保得住自己的财产，没有人可以偷走，也没有强权势力可以给我们抢走。那个时候，当官的那些人也不像今天这样可以有很多特权。

### 第三个习惯，区分事情的轻重缓急
  
也就是说，我自己要知道要达到我自己最终的目的，我首先要做什么。写下计划，制作个时间表，安排一些活动。如果我的计划是帮助十个人，那我应该采取那些步骤呢？也许我可以先赠送给他们小额的比特币，那么具体要如果做才能让他们觉着挺有意思的呢？

下面三个习惯是关于如何与他人合作的。

### 第四个习惯，努力制造双赢局面

举个例子，当你买一件商品的时候，这个就是双赢的。你得到了你想要的东西，人家得到钱。比特币必须得足够的好用，这样大家用它来买东西才不会觉得太麻烦，得不偿失。帮你的朋友设置一下，让他也能在自己的店里接受比特币。让他们亲眼看到，如果你用比特币，就避免了信用卡的高额手续费，这个是多么划算。

### 第五个习惯，先去努力了解他人，再去期待被了解

我们要努力去问问大家有什么感觉不方便的地方。大家是否知道上网的一些潜在危险呢？当他们做网上交易的时候，是不是在意有一个第三方来进来掺合？

其实事情永远都是这样，你可以给一匹马送上清泉，但是他喝不喝你可做不了主。说实话，有些人永远都不会对比特币感兴趣的，人家可能期待一种稳定，而对咱们所吹嘘的所谓自由这样的东西不是特别感冒。保证匿名权和隐私权有那么重要吗？不过，我们也应该庆幸，总会有一些人其实是一直在寻找自由的，只是他们不知道如何才能做到。比特币其实就是一个强化个人自由的工具，所以如果你把比特币介绍给这些人，很可能他们会眼前一亮。

### 第六个习惯，有效的团队合作

合作就是让每个人都发挥自己最强的方面，这样肯定要比一个人有力量的多，不管你技术多高，你也不可能一个人搞定一个大项目。

### 第七个习惯，持之以恒

不断的去平衡你的各种资源，不断的更新迭代你的各种资源和你自己的健康，保持一种长期的高效的生活方式。我们可以用锻炼去更新我们的身体，读书来更新我们的思想，服务社会来跟新我们的精神世界。

所以，与其每天坐在电脑前面呆上18个小时，不如站起来，多走走，多多帮助他人，哪怕是免费得也好。

总之，学会了这七种习惯，成了高效的比特币人，倒未必能让你变富有，但是你可以帮助他人找到自由。

25 years ago, Stephen R. Covey wrote a book, trying to steal 200 years of
success wisdom into just 7 habits. It became a international best seller,
which sold over 25 million copies, it's the  7 Habits of Highly Effective
People -- Powerful Lessons In Personal Change.
 
Today we will talk about the 7 habits of highly effective bitcoiners

### what is a Bitcoiner?

Bitcoiner is not just sb who use bitcoin to buy things, bitcoin is a way of
life. Bitcoiners believe in personal freedom. They believe you can conduct
transactions without involving a 3rd party, they believe your rights should be
protected, your rights of privacy, freedom of assembly, and keep your own
property. Someone who value these rights and value and values their freedom
and believes in conducting transactions in privacy can be a effective
bitcoiner. 

As much as we like our independence, we do live in a world with other people，
we like the people to value the principles as we do, we can not force them to,
but some of them do not even realize the value of the freedoms they should
claim.

The first 3 habits, are all about independence, about being a better person. 

### Habit 1: Be Proactive
Take initiative in life by realizing that your decisions (and how they align
with life's principles) are the primary determining factor for effectiveness
in your life. Take responsibility for your choices and the consequences that
follow.

In this book, he quotes serenity prayer from St. Francis， that says: 

God grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change; 
courage to change the things I can; 
and wisdom to know the difference.

He described the circle of influence that we center us within，
the people that we touch. Outside that circle is the circle of concern, things
we worried about， but we can not do anything about it，being proactive within
your circle of influence is the way to get things done.

### Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind

Self-discover and clarify your deeply important character values and life
goals. Envision the ideal characteristics for each of your various roles and
relationships in life.

It talked about putting a mission statement, when you clearly see what it is
you want, it's whole lot easier to get there. What is we want as bitcoiners?
Well we want a lot of the other people to use bitcoin. We want the tech tools
developed to preserve our rights and our freedom our liberty. The last episode
of MMM I talked about how the future is dark. 

Picture a world  of this darkness, hahaha, I don't mean a bad dark, I mean a
good darkness. A world where things we want to be private are private, a world
where our property we can keep for ourselves, not have it stolen from us, not
have it suddenly taken from us, a world where those in power do not have such
advantage anymore. 

You are working on a bitcoin related project? Write down what is you really
want to achieve with this project. Envision how many people you like to reach
out to and help them use bitcoin as well, and by bitcion I mean all the other
associated Dark Technologies. 

### Habit 3: Put First Things First
A manager must manage his own person. Personally. And managers should
implement activities that aim to reach the second habit. Covey says that rule
two is the mental creation; rule three is the physical creation.

habit 3 says, what is the first thing I should do to get started to reach that
end. Making the plan, laying out timeline, order a sequence of events, that
have to happen to reach that end, if my end is to reach 10 people, what's the
step I need to do? Maybe my plan is to give ten people 10 milibits. How do I
do that? What's the best way to get them excited and involved?

THE next 3 habits are interdependence then, when we really start to working
with others

### Habit 4: Think Win-Win

Genuine feelings for mutually beneficial solutions or agreements in your
relationships. Value and respect people by understanding a "win" for all is
ultimately a better long-term resolution than if only one person in the
situation had got his way.

When you buy sth, the idea is both ends win. You get the thing and they get
the money, that's a win win. Bitcoin has to be easy to use, so that others
don't see it has a losing proposition. Set up your friends business to be able
to accept bitcoin, show them how they win by not having to pay the credit card
fees. 

### Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, Then to be Understood

Use empathic listening to be genuinely influenced by a person, which compels
them to reciprocate the listening and take an open mind to being influenced by
you. This creates an atmosphere of caring, and positive problem solving.

Ask questions, seeking what's troubling the other person. Do they understand
the risks being on line, does it matter to them? when they conduct online
transaction. Do they care there is a 3rd party involved transaction. 

You an lay a horse water, but you can not make them to drink. Not everybody
got to be interested in bitcoin and freedom and liberty, and anonymity and
privacy. But there are people out there, who are looking for these things and
just have not found the answer yet. Find the thing they are interested in,
help them. Get them the solution.

### Habit 6: Synergize
Combine the strengths of people through positive teamwork, so as to achieve
goals no one person could have done alone.

You have skills, but you can't not do it all alone

The final habit is that of continuous improvement in both the personal and
interpersonal spheres of influence.

### Habit 7: Sharpen the Saw

Balance and renew your resources, energy, and health to create a sustainable,
long-term, effective lifestyle. It primarily emphasizes exercise for physical
renewal, prayer (meditation, yoga, etc.) and good reading for mental renewal.
It also mentions service to society for spiritual renewal.

Yes, help people for free, and don't sit in front your computer for 18 hours a
day, get up and walk around a little bit. 


### End

You may not get rich by applying the 7 habits, but you can help people find
their freedom.
